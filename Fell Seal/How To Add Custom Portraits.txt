** How to add custom portraits to the game **

Portrait images need to be png files with these dimensions:
Big portrait: 228x340
Small portrait: 64x72

And need to be named thus:
<name>-large.png
<name>-small.png

such as:
MyPortrait-large.png
MyPortrait-small.png

Then, go to the folder "My Documents\Fell Seal\customdata\portraits" on Windows, "~/Fell Seal/customdata/portraits" on Mac/Linux from your file explorer.

And in there, put your portrait files in the appropriate gender folders (female, male, unisex).
Your portraits will now appear as an option in the guild when recruiting a new character or customizing an existing one.

eg:

Windows:
"My Documents\Fell Seal\customdata\portraits\male\MyPortrait-large.png"
"My Documents\Fell Seal\customdata\portraits\male\MyPortrait-small.png"

Mac/Linux:
"~/Fell Seal/customdata/portraits/male/MyPortrait-large.png"
"~/Fell Seal/customdata/portraits/male/MyPortrait-small.png"
