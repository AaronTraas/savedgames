Most of the dlc1 files are there to show their data for example purposes, but cannot
be in customdata. Instead, just modify the base game file.

For example, dlc-Abilities.xml is not loaded from customdata, only Abilities.xml is loaded.
So, make your changes in Abilites.xml instead.

The only "dlc1-" files that will be loaded from customdata is:
dlc1-Missions.xml

Additionally, the "dlc1-" language files will be loaded, but you could still make your changes in the game base files instead if you wanted.
